It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. npm is used to install, share, and manage packages, which are collections of JavaScript code that can be used to perform specific tasks. npm allows developers to easily integrate third-party libraries and modules into their projects, making it easier to develop complex applications.

npm has a command-line interface that developers can use to install, update, and manage packages. npm also provides a central repository where developers can publish their packages, making it easy for others to discover and use them.

### OAuth:

OAuth is an open standard for authorization. It allows users to grant access to their private resources on one website to another website without giving them their credentials. OAuth is a safer and more secure way to access user data.

With OAuth, users can authenticate themselves and authorize third-party applications to access their data without exposing their passwords.
